# Toolkit for fake data generation in Golang

This library aims at facilitating creating fake data. (not ML based for now)

In order to do so, the library provides: 
- samples (first and last names, domain names, etc.)
- a UUID generator (UUID version 4)
- a standard User struct containing various common fields (email, name, id, etc.)

Random data available:
- [x] Unique ID (UUID v4)
- [x] Name
- [x] Postal address
- [x] Paragraph
- [x] Email address
- [x] User agent
- [x] URL
- [x] IP address
- [x] User (with name, email, etc.)
