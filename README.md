# Toolkit for fake data generation in Golang

This library aims at facilitating creating fake data.

Random data available:
- [x] Name
- [x] Postal address
- [x] Paragraph
- [x] Email address
- [x] User agent
- [x] Basic user (with name, email and ID)
- [x] IP address
- [x] Unique ID (UUID v4)
- [x] URL

Todo:
- [ ] Add unit tests

Possible improvements:
- [ ] Be able to only generate random IP addresses within a certain range
- [ ] Be able to control paragraph length
- [ ] Be able to generate locally consistent data (phone number / address / name / etc. from a given country)
